title: Using xAPI to track student events

## Define the events

As we saw in the previous post, [How Online Courses Gather Student Information](), there is a common way to register the events a student triggers when interacting with an elearning application. In this post we are going to explain how to do that by using xAPI and JavaScript.

## xAPI statements

First of all, we are going to track the events following the xAPI specification. This means that we are going to send the event information using the `statements` structure.

### Choose the vocabulary

What is a vocabulary? This is a very important step.

## Configure your LRS

If you want to test this, you have to configure an LRS (Learning Record System). There are several ways to configure one, I recommend you to use [LearningLocker](). If you want more information on how to create and connect a LRS, please write us an [email]().
